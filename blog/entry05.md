## What I learned about my tool

I learned that Animate.css is a library of ready-to-use, cross-browser animations for use in your web projects. There is a multitude of animations and you can changed and modify them to you liking. While Animate.css provides ready-to-use animations, developers can also customize the animations by modifying the CSS properties such as duration, delay, easing, and more. This allows for creating unique animation effects tailored to specific design requirements.
