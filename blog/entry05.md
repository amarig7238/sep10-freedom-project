## What I learned about my tool

I learned that Animate.css is a library of ready-to-use, cross-browser animations for use in your web projects. There is a multitude of animations and you can changed and modify them to your liking. You can customize the animations by modifying the CSS properties such as duration, delay, easing, and more. This allows for creating unique animation effects tailored to specific design requirements. There are different animations like bounce, flash, and jack in the box. There are also layouts, one being called key frames, which provides a flexible way to use Animate.css with your current projects without having to refactor your HTML code. Animate.css is a valuable tool for adding eye-catching animations to websites and web applications, enhancing user engagement and visual appeal.

## How I learned my tool

Learning my tool was too hard since the tool isn't super complicated to grasp. I used tutorial videos that i would try to find on youtube anytime i was stuck on a peice of code. They were helpful for everytime I was tinkering or learning on my own. As I am going through the video and messing around with animations in [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/dahicidebo/edit?html,css,output), when I use one's that are more than one word they wont work. I then looked back at the website where they hold all the animations ans see that animations like jack in the box are supposed to be written like jackInTheBox with a capital at the beggining of everyword.
