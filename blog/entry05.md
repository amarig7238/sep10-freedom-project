## What I learned about my tool

I learned that Animate.css is a library of ready-to-use, cross-browser animations for use in your web projects. There is a multitude of animations and you can changed and modify them to your liking. You can customize the animations by modifying the CSS properties such as duration, delay, easing, and more. This allows for creating unique animation effects tailored to specific design requirements. There are different animations like bounce, flash, and jack in the box. There are also layouts, one being called key frames, which provides a flexible way to use Animate.css with your current projects without having to refactor your HTML code. Animate.css is a valuable tool for adding eye-catching animations to websites and web applications, enhancing user engagement and visual appeal.

## How I learned my tool & what I tried to make

Learning my tool was too hard since the tool isn't super complicated to grasp. I used tutorial videos that I would try to find on YouTube anytime I was stuck on a piece of code. They were helpful for every time I was tinkering or learning on my own. As I am going through the video and messing around with animations in [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/dahicidebo/edit?html,css,output), when I use ones that are more than one word they won't work. I then looked back at the website where they hold all the animations and saw that animations like Jack in the box are supposed to be written like jackInTheBox with a capital letter at the beginning of every word except jack. While I was tinkering with my tool further I used the [animate.css](https://animate.style/) website to explore my tool further and see what else I can do to better my understanding. This website gave a couple of tutorials on how to use different layouts. As I was using the keyframes for some reason the animation wasn't doing anything until I realized I had the wrong animations matching each other so once I fixed it the animation worked. I tried these classes called delay classes. These are used to add delays directly to the element's class attribute. These can make an animation slower or faster. When I was using them I kept increasing the number but at some point, it just stopped. I then realized there was a cap on how big the delay number could be.
