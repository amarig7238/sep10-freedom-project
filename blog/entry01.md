# Entry 1:Dance and its evolution
##### 10/23/23

## Why dance?

The topic that I have chosen for the year-long project is dance. I chose the topic of dance because dance has had a really large impact on my life. Anytime I would be by myself I would turn on some music and dance. I was especially influenced by bigger figures that dance like Chris Brown and Micheal Jackson. I would always watch them dance and be amazed by their moves and their cognitive skills in how they come up with their next moves. Dance is a rhythmic move also known as moving to a beat and it can be a form of releasing stress or it can also be used to express an idea or share a message. I am obsessed with coming up with choreographies and thanks to the people who lead the way, creating dance moves for me to incorporate into my dances becomes easier by the day. I like seeing the creativity of other people and adding on to my own. [This link](https://medium.com/digital-literacy-for-decision-makers-columbia-b/technology-and-dance-blending-the-digital-and-physical-worlds-33589ff2bdd6) goes into depth on the main things that go into depth providing links on [muscular strength for dancers](https://presentingdenver.org/muscular-strength-for-dancers/), this link explaining why it is needed and even talking about the project in place to further evolve like [dust](https://vrdust.org.uk/)  which aims to evolve the way people see and experience contemporary dance through a 4 minute long immersive virtual reality experience. Lastly, my two backup ideas are music and singing.

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process where my main priority is to Define the problem. The problem that I plan to solve with my project is how to expand the technology of dance making more making it more entertaining and accessible. The next stage is to research the problem and also get the opinions of other people to see how they believe the problem could be solved.

## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are how to read and Creativity.

#### How to read
Looking at really big articles or websites can be very overwhelming. One may look at it like "What am I reading " because of all the words that were presented to them. But I learned to not read the whole thing but skim through what looks important or what sparks your interest. For example, if I looked up an article on the fundamentals of dance but was only interested in how to dance, I would only focus on the part talking about rhythm and beat instead of reading the whole article.

#### Creativity
Creativity is very crucial when you are doing a project on something you like or just something you picked. It's important to be original and make sure you do things to your liking when you are given that type of freedom. I realized that for me to make this project pleasing I will have to think outside of the box and do things that could really push and challenge my thinking to give me even more room to take advantage of my ability to be creative.

## Next Steps
I look forward to researching the expansion of technology in dance!
