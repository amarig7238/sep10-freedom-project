### Why dance?

The topic that I have chosen for the year-long project is dance. I chose the topic of dance because dance has had a really large impact on my life. Anytime I would be by myself I would turn on some music and dance. I was especially influenced by bugger figures that dance like Chris Brown and Micheal Jackson. I would always watch them dance and be amazed by their moves and their cognitive skills in how they come up with their next moves.

I am obsessed with coming up with choreographies and thanks to the people who lead the way, creating dance moves for me to incorporate into my dances becomes easier by the day. I like seeing the creativity of other people and adding on to my own. Lastly, my two backup ideas are music and singing.
