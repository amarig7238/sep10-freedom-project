### Why dance?

The topic that I have chosen for the year-long project is dance. I chose the topic of dance because dance has had a really large impact on my life. Anytime I would be by myself I would turn on some music and dance. I was especially influenced by bigger figures that dance like Chris Brown and Micheal Jackson. I would always watch them dance and be amazed by their moves and their cognitive skills in how they come up with their next moves. Dance is a rhythmic move also known as moving to a beat and it can be a form of releasing stress or it can also be used to express an idea or share a message. I am obsessed with coming up with choreographies and thanks to the people who lead the way, creating dance moves for me to incorporate into my dances becomes easier by the day. I like seeing the creativity of other people and adding on to my own.

### Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process where my main priority is to Define the problem. The problem that I plan to solve with my project is how to expand the technology of dance making more making it more entertaining and accesible. The next stage is to research the problem and also get the opinions of other people to see how they believe the problem could be solved.
