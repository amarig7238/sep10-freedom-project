# Tool Learning Log

Tool: Animate.css

3/11/24


* While learning my tool I figured finding a [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzbBcVRquYA) would help me understand my tool better since this was new material. The video gave a brief rundown going over the animate.css website and how to use it.

* I tried out different animations like bounce, flash, and jack in the box.

* As I am going through the video and messing around with animations in [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/dahicidebo/edit?html,css,output), when I use one's that are more than one word they wont work. I then looked back at the website where they hold all the animations ans see that animations like jack in the box are supposed to be written like jackInTheBox with a capital at the beggining of everyword.

* A question I still have is can I have the animations go off in a row meaning one after the other?

Tool: Animate.css

* While i was tinkering with my too further I used the [animate.css](https://animate.style/) website to explore my tool further and see what else I can do to better my understanding. This website gave a couple tutorials on how to use different layouts.

* I tried this layout called key frames which provides a flexible way to use Animate.css with your current projects without having to refactor your HTML code.

* As I am using the kayframes for some reason the animation wasnt doing anything until I realized I had the wrong animations matching eachother so once I fixed it the animation worked.

* A question I still have is, is it better to use HTML or Keyframes.
